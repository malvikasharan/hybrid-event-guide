# Storymapping for Events

## Summary

Guide to how to use storymapping and the personas you've generated / picked from the collection to help create better events

## Platform

We're on Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kuKO2us=/

## Contributions very appreciated ðŸŒˆ
- Read a storyboarding guide here: https://plan.io/blog/user-story-mapping/
- New to Miro? Read their user story mapping guide: https://miro.com/templates/user-story-map/
- Imagine that you are participating/organising a conference (or, start from [our personas template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1veZXxYutvHRtL_hv2lXOiH7AJorzZBs9ch3A0Qa4Xbc/edit?usp=sharing)!): Did we miss any objectives/tasks? Please feel free to add to the miro board (you will need to sign up for an account and request access to the board, unfortunately)
    - Please feel free to help us build more personas

## A record of how we started build the story map
1. Building from Personas: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1veZXxYutvHRtL_hv2lXOiH7AJorzZBs9ch3A0Qa4Xbc/edit?usp=sharing (this is a redacted version for data privacy reasons)
    - Why do people want to join?
    - What's stopping people from joining / painpoints

Useful categories for personas
* Nationality: do you need a visa to get to the event
    * Minimum time to plan your trip
* Transport connections: 
* Resource availability for online events:
    * Do you have a suitable space and computing setup to join online
    * Do you have caring responsibilities
* Resource availability for in-person events:
    * Personality
    * Energy levels
* Frustrations were often not part of 
* Funding situation


2. Swimlanes for participants and organisers
- we realised that we needed seperate lanes for virtual and remote participants
